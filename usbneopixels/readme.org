 2. preferences -> "Additional Boards Manager URLs"
 3. http://digistump.com/package_digistump_index.json
 4. Boards -> Boards manager -> digispark
 5. Boards -> "Digispark (Default - 16.5Mhz)"

 - If uploading fails then try with different usb female ports (Some
   copy digisparks have wrong sizes so not all usb ports are
   supported)
